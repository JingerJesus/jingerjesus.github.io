        <h3>
            First off: What is Assembly Language?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Any programming language that has a 1:1 correlation from written instruction to machine instructions 
            can be considered an assembly language. Usually, these languages are written to be very intimate with
            the computer <a href="hardwaremain.html">hardware</a>, and are effectively direct translations of the  
            CPU's machine code instructions. <br><br>
            For example, the JUMP command takes an 11-bit argument, so if the computer is told to JUMP to an address 
            labelled 312, the Assembly instruction would be "JUMP 312", and the machine would interpret that as 
            "01101-00100111000". Here, the first five bits, 01101, refer to the JUMP command, and the remaining 11 bits 
            are the binary value for 312. <br><br><br>

        <h3>
            Defining the Tower of Babel Assembly Language:
        </h3>
        <p>
            When designing a computer as far down as this, you are allowed all sorts of liberties when defining your 
            custom assembly code. As long as there is a hardware operation that can be defined withing your computer, 
            you are allowed to make it do whatever you want. I went with a few basic operations, added a physical 
            <a href="stack.html">instruction stack</a>, complete with a counter, RAM addresses, and full integration 
            into the assembly. The idea of recursive assembly code scares me a little bit, so that will be used in 
            higher level languages. Addition of a stack in hardware is completely optional, since it can be easily 
            replicated through software alone, but my instruction RAM sizes were already a little bit smaller than I 
            would have liked, so I allotted an extra slice of memory for it. <br><br><br>
