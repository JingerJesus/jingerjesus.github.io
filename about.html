            This website is intended to be a design journal, as well as fully functional documentation for both / 
            all of the programming languages written to communicate with this computer. <br><br>

            There were two versions of this computer. The older version was not finished, due to multiple 
            issues with RAM capacity and the simulation software. <br>
            The only remaining <a href="old-comp.html"> artifacts </a> are a short video of the processor running, and a screenshot of 
            the simulation. <br>
            If you want to explore the blueprints of the new computer, click 
            <a href="hardwaremain.html">here.</a><br>
            If you would like to skip that entirely and jump into the Assembly language, click 
            <a href="assembly.html">here.</a><br>
