            Breaking Down the Hardware
        </h3>
        <p>
            The Tower of Babel's hardware can be split up into four main sections: Data Processing, The Stack, 
            Control Logic, and Memory. 
        </p>
        <h3>
            Data Processing:
        </h3>
        <p>
            The data processing portion of the computer consists of 4 
            all-purpose <a href="registerbp.html">registers</a>, the Arithmetic Logic Unit <a href="alu.html">(ALU)</a>, a Flag 
            Register, and two Output registers. <br><br>

            The four all-purpose registers, labelled A-D respectively, are used for temporary data storage and 
            allows for data manipulation via the ALU. The vast majority of operations run entirely within these
            few components. <br><br>

            Math operations and basic boolean logic happens within the ALU, however the four all-purpose registers
            help to feed data in and allow for anything to happen
